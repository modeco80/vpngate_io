# `capi` readme

This subdirectory contains the C API bindings to vpngate_io. These are intended for the following purposes:

- Allowing interfacing in a program writen in C (Why you would do this in `$YEAR` is beyond me)
- Allowing interfacing in languages which allow FFI like LuaJIT, Rust, so on.

They are currently not very stable.
